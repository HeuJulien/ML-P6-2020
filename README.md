## Lecture's notes  
The lecture's notes can be found in their respective folders

## TP
* **TP0 & TP1 must be sent before Friday 09/10 23h59**
* Room 22-23 114
* It is recommended (but not mandatory) to work in groups of two
* You are encouraged to bring your own laptop 
* You should create your own GitHub account and upload your notebooks/projects there (a great guide : https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/ )  
* You'll have to send (or upload on GitHub) your TP's notebook  regularly (dates will be updated)

## Seminars
During the semester there will be 4 seminars where researchers will present you their work and how they use machine learning  
* 02/11 : A. Marco Saitta // Condensed Matter  
* 16/11 : Martin Weigt // Biophysics  
* 23/11 : Bertrand Laforge // Elementary particles    
* 30/11 : Karim Benabed // Astrophysics  
  
## Modalities  
* 25% - TP : We do not expect you to complete all the notebooks, but the more the better
* 75% - Project, which contains :
  * 25% - Report : We expect a ~10 pages report, following the usual context/tools/results form
  * 25% - Code : We expect a readable code, following the PEP8 conventions (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  * 25% - Presentation : We expect a 10 minutes presentation followed by 5 minutes of questions

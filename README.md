## Lecture's notes  
The lecture's notes can be found in their respective folders

## TP
* It is recommended (but not mandatory) to work in groups of two
* You are encouraged to bring your own laptop 
* You should create your own GitHub account and upload your notebooks/projects there
* You'll have to send (or upload on GitHub) your TP's notebook  regularly (dates will be updated)

## Seminars
During the semester there will be 4 seminars where researchers will present you their work and how they use machine learning  
* 05/10 : A. Marco Saitta // Condensed Matter  
* 19/10 : Martin Weigt // Biophysics  
* 02/11 : Karim Benabed // Astrophysics  
* 23/11 : Bertrand Laforge // Elementary particles    
(dates still need to be confirmed)  
  
## Modalities  
* 25% - TP : We do not expect you to complete all the notebooks, but the more the better
* 75% - Project, which contains :
  * 25% - Report : We expect a ~10 pages report, following the usual context/tools/results form
  * 25% - Code : We expect a readable code, following the PEP8 conventions (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
  * 25% - Presentation : We expect a 10 minutes presentation followed by 5 minutes of questions

## Other ressources  
* Last year course : https://github.com/krzakala/ml_P6_2019_web (The TPs you'll find there won't be the ones you'll have to do in class)  
* Course on computational science : http://www.lps.ens.fr/~krzakala/m2.html
* Other ML course : https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/ML_physique.html  
Most of the lectures have been based on those courses

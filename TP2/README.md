## TP2
* This is TP2, in this TP we apply what was seen in lectures about linear regression, ridge and LASSO
* In this TP, there is a mandatory part which is basically things you need to know in order to make your project. In the bonus part there are mainly theoreticalquestions. Don't bother with it if you are late on your work or struggling with basic concepts, the main things are in the mandatory part
